Projects related to Data Science and Machine learning. My Training / Learning Arena 

## Projects
- [**Weather prediction:**](weather/weather.ipynb) Small dataset(under 5000 samples) about atmospheric characteristics. Predict whether weather is humid or dry. 80%  classifying accuracy. 
- [**Tweet.ai:**](https://github.com/kenrii/Tweet.ai) This web application analyses the last 1000 tweets of the searched topic with a machine learning model. Tweets can be either negative, neutral or positive(Sentimental analysis). 
- [**Digit recognizer(Kaggle):**](Digit-recognizer/digreg_model.ipynb) This was the first time when I participated in Kaggle Competition. Build CNN model for recognizing handwritten digits(0-9). I wanted to learn more about the basics of deep learning and computer vision. 97% classifying accuracy.
